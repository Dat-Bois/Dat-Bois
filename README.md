> The concept of a ‘Ballmer Peak’ was first proposed in 2007, postulating that there exists a very specific blood alcohol content which confers superhuman programming ability. [...] We conclusively refute the existence of a specific peak with large magnitude, but with 𝑝 <0.001 find that there was a significant positive effect to a low amount of alcohol—slightly less than two drinks—on programming ability. *- The Ballmer Peak: An Empirical Search*
